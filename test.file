Donald Trump
First thoughts
What do Trump and Brexiters have in common? A disregard for all but themselves

Both property billionaire Donald Trump and the UK’s Tory ‘outers’ are anti any establishment that limits them and will blame anyone who gets in their way

Everybody knows one thing: no level of UK national sovereignty would make the US presidency irrelevant to these islands. Yet there’s nothing else to do but look on in baffled awe as Donald Trump strides purposefully towards his goal: leader of the free world. Such a spectacle may be good for a laugh, even at this stage. But Trump has so far derived only benefit from the fact that the establishment has not taken him seriously. It is the single thing that helps him most in presenting himself as the anti-establishment candidate.

How can it be, you ask yourself, that people are so willing to believe that a billionaire property developer is a man of the people? How can it be that Trump is the phoenix that rises from the ashes of a financial crash brought about largely by speculative property development?

Trump’s victory celebration after the Super Tuesday results – in which he won seven out of the 11 Republican states up for grabs – was an object lesson in conspicuous elitism. It took place on his luxury Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida. Entrance was by exclusive invitation only.

Yet jibes about this being an odd sort of populism will only annoy Trump’s supporters. If Trump has one message for his fellow Americans, it is this: “Congratulate yourself on your successes in whatever way you choose to. For your failures, blame others.” Greed is good. Selfishness is generous. Look out for number one – I did it, and so can you.

It’s liberating – the idea that you’d be sitting pretty if others hadn’t ruined things for you. Trump insists that those others are immigrants – Muslims, Mexicans, whatever. He resists adding African-Americans to his list. But his recent claim that he didn’t know enough about former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, David Duke, to condemn him, speaks for itself. The allegations that Trump has used illegal workers himself? That simply doesn’t touch him.

 Help! I’m being seduced by Donald Trump

It’s no use sneering at Trump, and sighing: “Only in America.” The reason why Britain doesn’t have a Trump is because the discontents that Trump voices in the US are voiced here in a more coded way – as opposition to the EU. An English builder will complain that his hourly rate has been sent plummeting by a Polish builder. Somehow, the guy who is maximising his own profit by paying as little as he can for honest, skilled labour, is not the one to blame.

Divide and rule. Arch Tories like Boris Johnson, Iain Duncan Smith and Chris Grayling don’t want Brexit because they’re worried that the profits of property developers are too large, any more than Trump worries about it. The US controls its own borders, and all it means is that illegal labour is cheaper,more clandestine, more vulnerable. Trump and the Tory Brexiters are cut from the same cloth. They’re anti an establishment that limits and contains them. They want to be at the centre of an establishment in which they are free to do whatever they please.

This is a narrow view of Brexiters. We're not all Tories, we're not all right wing. I definitely am not.

The only discernible difference I can make out between a Trump supporter and a Sanders supporter is that one is wearing shoes and a shirt.

Delightfully superficial. Why look deeper into their minds when you can just judge them by their hair and clothing? You could easily make it as a soft-drink marketing executive.
